Question,Answer
"What should I do if I miss a dose of my medication?","If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it's almost time for your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Never double up on doses unless specifically instructed by your doctor. Contact your healthcare provider if you're unsure."
"When should I go to the emergency room versus urgent care?","Go to the emergency room for life-threatening conditions like chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe bleeding, stroke symptoms, or severe injuries. Urgent care is appropriate for non-life-threatening issues like minor cuts, sprains, mild infections, or cold and flu symptoms that need same-day attention."
"How long should I wait before calling about test results?","Most test results are available within 3-7 days. If you haven't heard back within the timeframe your doctor mentioned, it's appropriate to call. For urgent tests, ask your doctor when to expect results. Remember that no news doesn't always mean good news - always follow up."
"Can I request my medical records?","Yes, you have a legal right to access your medical records. Contact your healthcare provider's medical records department and submit a written request. There may be a small copying fee. You should receive your records within 30 days in most cases."
"What immunizations do adults need?","Adults typically need annual flu shots, Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) every 10 years, shingles vaccine at age 50+, pneumonia vaccines at 65+, and COVID-19 vaccines. Your specific needs may vary based on age, health conditions, travel plans, and occupation. Consult your doctor for personalized recommendations."
"How do I prepare for a fasting blood test?","Don't eat or drink anything except water for 8-12 hours before your test (follow your doctor's specific instructions). Take your regular medications unless told otherwise. Schedule your test for early morning so you can eat soon after. You may drink water to stay hydrated."
"What should I bring to my first appointment with a new doctor?","Bring your photo ID, insurance card, list of current medications (including over-the-counter and supplements), list of allergies, relevant medical records, list of questions you want to ask, and a summary of your medical history including past surgeries and major illnesses."
"Is it normal to get a second opinion?","Yes, getting a second opinion is completely normal and often recommended, especially for serious diagnoses, major surgeries, or complex conditions. Most doctors support this and won't be offended. Your insurance may even require it for certain procedures."
"How can I manage prescription costs?","Ask your doctor about generic alternatives, check if pharmaceutical companies offer patient assistance programs, compare prices at different pharmacies, look into prescription discount cards, consider 90-day supplies for maintenance medications, and talk to your insurance about preferred pharmacies."
"What does 'take with food' really mean?","'Take with food' usually means taking your medication during or immediately after a meal or substantial snack. This helps prevent stomach upset and can improve absorption for some medications. A few crackers typically isn't enough - aim for at least a small meal or snack."
"When should I schedule my annual physical?","Schedule your annual physical when you're generally healthy, not when you're sick with acute issues. Many people choose the same month each year (like their birthday month) to make it easier to remember. Book several weeks in advance as these appointments fill up quickly."
"Can I exercise when I'm sick?","Use the 'neck rule': if symptoms are above the neck (runny nose, mild sore throat), light exercise is usually okay. If symptoms are below the neck (chest congestion, body aches, fever, stomach issues), rest until you feel better. Always listen to your body and consult your doctor if unsure."
"What's the difference between a copay and a deductible?","A copay is a fixed amount you pay for a specific service (like $30 for an office visit). A deductible is the total amount you must pay out-of-pocket each year before your insurance starts covering costs. After meeting your deductible, you typically still pay copays or coinsurance."
"How do I know if my symptoms require immediate attention?","Seek immediate care for: severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, sudden severe headache, vision changes, weakness on one side of the body, uncontrolled bleeding, severe allergic reactions, suicidal thoughts, high fever with stiff neck, or severe abdominal pain."
"What should I do if I have a medication side effect?","For severe reactions (difficulty breathing, swelling, severe rash), seek emergency care immediately. For mild side effects, contact your doctor - don't stop taking prescribed medication without guidance. Document what you're experiencing and when it started."
"How often should I get screened for common conditions?","Screening schedules vary by age and risk factors. Generally: blood pressure annually, cholesterol every 4-6 years (more often if high risk), diabetes screening every 3 years after age 45, colonoscopy starting at age 45, mammograms starting at age 40-50, and skin checks annually if high risk. Your doctor will personalize recommendations."
"Can I refuse a treatment my doctor recommends?","Yes, you have the right to refuse any treatment. However, make sure you understand the risks and benefits. Ask questions, discuss alternatives, and make an informed decision. Your doctor should respect your choice while ensuring you understand the potential consequences."
"What does it mean when my doctor says something is 'within normal limits'?","This means your test results fall within the expected range for healthy individuals. However, 'normal' is a range, and what's normal for you might be different from the average. If you have concerns about results that are technically normal, discuss them with your doctor."
"How can I better communicate with my doctor during appointments?","Prepare a written list of concerns prioritized by importance, bring a list of medications, write down questions, take notes or ask if you can record the conversation, bring a friend or family member for support, and don't hesitate to ask for clarification if you don't understand something."
"What's the difference between urgent and emergent?","Emergent conditions are life-threatening and require immediate emergency room care (heart attack, stroke, severe trauma). Urgent conditions need prompt attention within 24 hours but aren't immediately life-threatening (possible fracture, urinary tract infection, minor cuts needing stitches)."
"Should I take antibiotics for a cold or flu?","No, antibiotics don't work against viruses like those causing colds and flu. They only treat bacterial infections. Taking antibiotics unnecessarily can lead to antibiotic resistance. Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics only if you have a bacterial infection."
"How do I properly dispose of unused medications?","Don't flush medications down the toilet (unless label specifically says to). Use drug take-back programs at pharmacies or law enforcement locations. If none available, mix pills with undesirable substance (coffee grounds, cat litter) in a sealed bag and throw in trash. Remove personal information from containers."
"What should I include in my personal health record?","Include: current medications and doses, allergies, immunization history, major illnesses and diagnoses, surgeries and hospitalizations, family medical history, emergency contacts, insurance information, and your doctors' contact information. Keep both digital and physical copies."
"Is telehealth as effective as in-person visits?","Telehealth is effective for many conditions including follow-ups, medication management, mental health appointments, minor acute issues, and chronic disease management. However, some situations require in-person exams, diagnostic tests, or procedures. Your doctor will advise which format is most appropriate."
"What does 'NPO after midnight' mean before surgery?","NPO stands for 'nothing by mouth' (from Latin 'nil per os'). It means no food, drinks, candy, gum, or even water after midnight before your procedure. This reduces the risk of complications from anesthesia. Follow your surgeon's specific instructions as timing may vary."
